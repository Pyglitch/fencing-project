step 0:
fixin up imports

step 1:
completed
modify prints to write pose to text file

step 2:
only write pose when it changes?

step 3:
implement more pose tracking:
en garde pose


duck pose
	knee angles may become acute
	and also y values for head will decrease



	3.1:
	if fencer *returns* to en garde (after a lunge etc),
	then point was scored
	fencer must be in en garde AND before the starting line
		big chance that fencer may go from lunge to en garde WITHOUT scoring a point
note:
line for starting position is fixed distance
this can be used to help track if fencer is resetting to en garde maybe
